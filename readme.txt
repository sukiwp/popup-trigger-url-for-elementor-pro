Helps you to trigger Elementor Pro's popups (open, close, or toggle) from menus or any kind of link.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to trigger any Elementor Pro's popup using links at anywhere, even outside the Elementor's content.

= Usage examples =

- Open a popup using a link inside Gutenberg or Classic Editor.
- Open a popup using a link inside a widget.
- Open a popup from Menus (using `Custom Link`).
- etc.

= How it works =

1. Install this plugin and make sure you have created your popup using Elementor and Elementor Pro.
2. Go to `Templates > Popups` and click the `Show URLs` button of the popup you want to show.
2. Copy the URL of the trigger type you chose (`open` and `toggle` is the most common type).
3. Paste the URL on any link that you want to use to trigger the popup (e.g. `Custom Link` on your Menus).
4. Done! Now you can open your popup from outside Elementor's content.

= Disclaimer =

- This plugin only reveals the trigger URLs that are originally generated by Elementor Pro itself. This plugin doesn't use any other custom method to trigger your popup.
- The trigger URLs only work with `<a>` tag. This plugin uses the same Elementor's Javascript which only detects link in `<a>` tag.

= "Not working, my popup doesn't show" =

- Please check if the popup can be triggered using Elementor's Dynamic Action link. If it can't be triggered, then there must be something wrong in your popup configuration, not the trigger URL from our plugin.
- Please make sure that you have properly set the popup's "Display Conditions". Otherwise, your popup won't show up.
- Please make sure that you copied the trigger URL correctly into your link.
- Please check if there is javascript error that might be caused by other plugins (check your browser's Developer Tools > Console).
